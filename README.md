 # React Developer Portfolio

  ## Description
  
  My personal web development portfolio built as a single page application using React. The page has a similar color scheme to React to highlight the correlation but    also because I simply like the color scheme as it is modern and sleek as well as matching the coloring of the personal image that I chose. The portfolio also makes use of emailjs to allow viewers to send messages that will be redirected to my personal email address. The page also makes use of bootstrap styling and and a resume icon from Rukanicon.

  ## Installation
  
  If you wanted to install and modify for your own purposes, clone down the repository and use `npm i` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to turn on the server. In addition to the all of the projects and personal information you would also need to change the homepage in the package.json for GitHub pages and the service id, template id, and the account id in the handle submit function of contact.jsx - otherwise I will receive all of the messages intended for you. 
  
  ## Usage

  Use the navbar to navigate to the different pages. Enter the required info and message into the form and submit to send me a message. Click on the header of the project cards to go to the repo and the image of the project cards to go to the deployment.
